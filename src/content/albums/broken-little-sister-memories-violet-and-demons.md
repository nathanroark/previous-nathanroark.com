## Thoughts

Love this album, fantastic for anyone who has liked shoegaze or noise pop. Extremely bright, loud and distorted guitar all over this album. The vocals are very soft and dreamy that sound as if they are coming from far away and very loud at the same time. The lo-fi production adds a lot to the atmosphere of the album while really feeding into the overall dreamy and loudness. Every song on this album feels like it was genetically engineered to cause you to get lost in it and it's beautiful for that. Highly recommend, please give this one a listen.
