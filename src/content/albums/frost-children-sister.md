## Highlights

#### Falling

- Older sounding EDM song that pulls of the style well.

#### Control

- Heavy electronic pop drops with pop punk vocals. Fun ideas that are executed well on this track.

#### RADIO

- Rubbery bouncy base with electro synths. Solid pop banger

#### Ralph Lauren

- Psychedelic pop edm track. Fun, plays with that sound well.
