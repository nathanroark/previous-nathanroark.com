## Thoughts

This album is very simple and has a lot 90s pop insparation on it.
It really isn't something I would normally enjoy but there is something really enjoyable that keeps me coming back to it.
The leading song, Trampoline, has such a comforting feel to it with a simple repetative hook that makes me relax each time I start listing to the album.
Flicker is also a great song on the album. It feels like it is made to be played on the radio in the 90s and gives me that 'listening to the radio to wind down' that few songs can give me.
I would highly recommend this song if you'd like something comfy and simple to enjoy.
