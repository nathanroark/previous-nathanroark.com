Some amazing tracks on here. So really creative and new ideas that I love but it isn't consistant.

Tracks like 2010 Justin Bieber have inspiring and fun production but for every one of those 10/10 songs there is a meh song somewhere else on the album.

Still going to be one of my favorite albums of the year and an album I come back to often for those amazing songs. I'm excited to see future projects from this artist.
