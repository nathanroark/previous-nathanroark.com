Some amazing songs on this album, Heroin might be my favorite song of the 60s.

However, I dislike how many parts of this album cause it to not feel like one cohesive project.

All of Nico's parts feel forced and to cause the project to divert from the vision of what it could'be been. I guess that makes me part of the group that considers Andy Warhol's contributions to this band to be its biggest detriment.
