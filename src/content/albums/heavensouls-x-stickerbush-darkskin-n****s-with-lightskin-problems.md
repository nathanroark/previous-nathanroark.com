Good ideas, interesting sounds, but it is incomplete. There is enough talent and thought here for a fantastic album it just needs organization and for it be made into conherent ideas.

The best way to put it is if someone was singing in a beautiful voice but all the words were giberish.

## Highlights

#### southern style lemon peppers

- Track has a lot of great sounds on it, 8 minutes of them all kinda scattered around but it's interesting.

#### i am not your savior (feat. Kelly Garlick)

- Loud, distored, beautiful synths toward then end that are very pretty.

#### bitch gimme my kicks back

- Amazing intro, goes into serveral more great riffs and jams.
