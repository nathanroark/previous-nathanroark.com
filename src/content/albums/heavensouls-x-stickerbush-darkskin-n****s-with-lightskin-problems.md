## Highlights

#### southern style lemon peppers

- Track has a lot of great sounds on it, 8 minutes of them all kinda scattered around but it's interesting.

#### i am not your savior (feat. Kelly Garlick)

- Loud, distored, beautiful synths toward then end that are very pretty.

#### bitch gimme my kicks back

- Amazing intro, goes into serveral more great riffs and jams.
